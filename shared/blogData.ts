    excerpt: "In today's fast-paced clinical environment, dermatologists face a unique challenge: balancing high patient volumes with the need for detailed documentation and accurate billing.",
    content: `
## Why General EHRs Can't Keep Up With Dermatology

Dermatology is one of the few specialties that combines visual diagnosis, procedural work, and longitudinal tracking across hundreds of skin conditions, often in under 10 minutes per patient. Most systems labeled as general EHR for dermatology platforms weren't built with that in mind.

Dermatologists aren't just entering vitals and prescribing medications. They're mapping lesions, tracking cosmetic outcomes, reviewing pathology reports, and juggling complex coding, all while maintaining patient trust in a highly visual specialty.

### Specialty Software Isn't a Luxury - It's a Clinical Advantage

The right dermatology EHR software doesn't just reduce clicks. It reshapes how a practice functions, from decision-making to documentation flow. With MD Charts, this looks like:

- **Streamlined workflows** for scheduling, documentation, and billing
- **Automated coding suggestions** minimize errors and accelerate reimbursements
- **Optimized dermatology revenue cycle management**, ensuring steady cash flow

### When Systems Match Clinical Thinking, Outcomes Improve

Clinical software should never force providers to think like the system. Instead, the system should model the way clinicians think. In dermatology, that means:

- **Pre-configured dermatology-specific EHR templates** simplify documentation
- **Automated data entry** ensures fluid, responsive charting
- **Visual charting tools** to create a clinical narrative that supports real-time insight

### Time is Money! The Cost of Working Around the Wrong Tools

Every extra minute spent hunting for the right code, toggling between screens, or rewriting documentation adds up, not just in lost time, but in lost focus.

With the right EHR for dermatology that is built specifically for the dermatology industry, practitioners can enjoy:

- **Secure messaging** enables instant communication with staff and providers

We know that implementing a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system is a significant endeavor for medical offices, especially balancing execution and transition while continuing to deliver efficient and high-quality patient care. We often talk to doctors who are worried that the transition to a new EHR will be long and messy.

In this post, we're exploring strategies that expedite the implementation process of electronic health records systems. The following ideas are based on our experience as an EHR provider and the onboarding processes we developed:

## Engaging Key Stakeholders

Your EHR system should align seamlessly with your practice's specific workflows and requirements, while proactively addressing any concerns that may arise. By actively engaging clinicians, administrators, and other key personnel, and fostering collaboration and communication throughout, your EHR provider can better understand your needs and design a smoother and more efficient transition.

## Putting Together a Well-Defined EHR Implementation Plan

A key aspect of expediting the implementation of EHR platforms is developing a well-defined implementation plan and structured process. We work closely with providers to create a customized plan with clear and achievable objectives, milestones, and timelines. By breaking the EHR implementation into manageable phases and prioritizing the essential features of each unique practice, MD Charts ensures efficient deployment, allowing providers to understand what is expected of them in each stage of the implementation cycle. This allows MD Charts to accurately architect the system to meet their needs.

## Allocating Adequate Resources and Skill Sets

Resource allocation is a key component in a smooth implementation of EHR systems. Following a careful assessment, your EHR implementation team should determine what internal skill sets and resources (e.g. physicians, nurses, admins, billers, etc.) will be needed at each stage of the system's implementation. Allocating the right resource at the right times minimizes delays and ensures timely completion of tasks. You should be able to keep your focus on patient care while the new EHR is put in place.

## Embracing Change Management

Implementing a new EHR does require adapting to the system's workflows. The EHR's implementation team should be knowledgeable and experienced. They should recognize the challenges associated with change management, offer comprehensive strategies to minimize resistance and maximize user adoption. Through proactive communication and training during the implementation phase, and ongoing support, your EHR provider should facilitate a smooth transition.

## Monitoring and Evaluating Your New EHR System

Throughout the process of implementing electronic health records systems, it is important to closely monitor and evaluate results. During implementation, your EHR provider should perform assessments of milestones, timelines, and resource allocation to identify any obstacles or deviations from the plan.

Once your office starts using the new EHR, it is recommended to periodically work with your EHR company to ensure that your system continues to meet your growing needs. This will allow your EHR provider to tweak the system and improve its utility for you over time. Some systems (like MD Charts) were designed with greater levels of flexibility, allowing us to adjust some of the settings to better suit the needs of each user.

    title: "Preventing Claim Denials Before They Happen",
    excerpt: "Most billing teams are good at working denials  -  but the same denial reasons keep showing up month after month. That's not a staff problem. It's a workflow design problem. Here's how to stop managing denials and start preventing them.",
    content: `
## The Case for Proactive Revenue Cycle Management

Here is something worth sitting with for a moment.

Most billing teams are genuinely good at working denials. Fast turnaround, solid follow-up, strong appeal rates. And yet the same denial reasons keep showing up month after month. The queue never actually shrinks  -  it just keeps refilling.

That is not a staff performance problem. It is a **workflow design problem.** Because the denial didn't start when the payer rejected the claim. It started days  -  sometimes weeks  -  earlier. At patient registration. In the coding step. In a prior authorization request that nobody followed up on before the appointment.

By the time a denial lands in your billing queue, the mistake that caused it is long gone. The only question left is how much of the revenue you can recover  -  and how much just disappears.

There is a better way to think about this. Stop managing denials. Start preventing them.

## Denial Rates Are Climbing  -  and the Root Cause Is Not What You'd Expect

The numbers coming out of recent industry surveys are not encouraging for anyone running a revenue cycle right now.

Experian Health's *State of Claims 2025* report  -  which surveyed 250 revenue cycle leaders across U.S. healthcare  -  found that **41% of providers now report denial rates of 10% or higher.** That figure was 30% in 2022. Three years, and denial rates have moved that sharply in the wrong direction. The same report found that 68% of providers say submitting clean claims is harder today than it was a year ago.

Payers are tightening requirements. Medicare Advantage plans in particular have become significantly more aggressive in claims review  -  with commercial and MA denials both rising from 2023 to 2024 according to OS Healthcare's denial rate index analysis published in 2025.

And here's what gets missed in most of these conversations: the number one cause of rising denials is not payer aggression or coding complexity.

**It is inaccurate or incomplete data collected at patient registration.** Per the same Experian Health report, missing or inaccurate claim data was cited by 50% of respondents as their primary driver of rising denials  -  up from 46% the year before. More than a quarter of providers said at least 10% of their denials trace directly back to intake errors.

A wrong digit in a member ID, an insurance plan that lapsed and was never re-verified, a prior auth requirement nobody flagged at scheduling. These are not complex billing problems. They are data collection failures that happen at the front desk and surface as claim rejections 30 days later.

Fixable. All of it. But only if you catch them before the claim goes out  -  not after.

## Reactive Management vs. Actual Prevention

Most denial management programs are built to handle denials well. Fast appeal workflows, good follow-up cadence, solid recovery rates. Nothing wrong with any of that  -  but it is still reactive. You are recovering revenue that should not have been put at risk in the first place.

Proactive denial prevention is a different posture entirely. It means building checkpoints into your workflow that catch errors before the claim ever leaves your system.

The financial case for prevention is straightforward. Per MGMA's 2024 denial benchmarking data, up to 15% of claims are denied or delayed  -  and nearly two-thirds of those are recoverable **if the practice has the systems to work them.** The ones that aren't recovered represent permanent revenue loss. Not delayed. Gone.

For most small and mid-size practices, the bandwidth to systematically work every single denial simply doesn't exist. Some get appealed. Some get resubmitted. A portion just falls through and the revenue disappears quietly, month after month, without anyone tracking the cumulative impact.

The better investment is stopping the denial from happening. And that means rethinking where in your workflow errors are actually being introduced.

## Where the Errors Actually Enter the Workflow

Walk through a typical claim cycle and the exposure points become obvious.

A patient books an appointment. Nobody checks whether their insurance is still active or whether the scheduled procedure requires prior authorization. They come in, receive care, and the provider documents the visit.

The documentation moves to billing. A coder assigns CPT and ICD-10 codes  -  sometimes manually re-entering information from the clinical record, sometimes working from a summary that doesn't capture everything in the note. The claim gets submitted.

Three weeks later, a denial comes back. Wrong payer ID. Missing modifier. Auth required. Coverage lapsed.

Every one of those failure points had an earlier moment where it could have been caught. The lapsed coverage could have been caught at scheduling. The auth requirement could have been flagged before the appointment. The missing modifier could have been caught in a pre-submission validation check.

Instead, they turn into denials and now you're paying to fix what could have been prevented.

The consistent culprits, backed by the Experian Health 2025 data, are:

- Missing or inaccurate patient and insurance data collected at intake
- Prior authorization requirements not identified before the service is delivered
- Coding errors  -  incorrect CPT/ICD-10 combinations, missing modifiers, NCCI bundling conflicts
- Eligibility not re-verified before the visit for returning patients

None of these are mysteries. They follow predictable patterns. Which means a system built to intercept them will catch the same issues before submission every time  -  rather than discovering them again on the denial remittance.

## How MDCharts Is Built to Catch This Earlier

MDCharts is an integrated EHR and RCM platform  -  clinical documentation, coding, and billing in the same system. That matters here because most handoff errors happen at the seams between disconnected tools. When the provider documents in one system, the biller codes in another, and the claim is submitted through a third, each transition is a point where data can be lost, misread, or re-entered incorrectly.

With MDCharts, that chain is shorter. Here is what is actually in place:

### Eligibility Verification Before the Encounter

MDCharts verifies insurance eligibility before the patient is seen  -  active coverage status, copay requirements, and authorization flags for scheduled procedures. Not a manual phone call to the payer. Not something the front desk has to remember to do. A verification that runs as part of the scheduling and check-in workflow.

This is the single highest-impact step in denial prevention. Catching a lapsed coverage situation or a missing auth requirement before the appointment happens prevents a category of denials that practices deal with constantly  -  and avoids the uncomfortable conversation with the patient after the fact.

### Superbill Tied Directly to the Clinical Encounter

In MDCharts, the superbill flows from the clinical documentation. Diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and modifiers are connected to what was actually documented and ordered in the encounter  -  not re-entered manually by a biller working from a summary or a handwritten note.

This removes a translation step. And translation steps, in billing, create errors. The coder is still applying judgment  -  the platform doesn't replace that  -  but the raw material they are working from is the actual clinical record, not a downstream copy of it.

### Claim Validation Before Submission

Before a claim leaves MDCharts through the clearinghouse, it runs through validation checks. Mismatched diagnosis and procedure code combinations get flagged. Missing required fields surface. NCCI edit conflicts are caught.

Claims that fail this check don't go out until someone reviews and corrects the issue. **A denial that never happens costs nothing to work.** That is the logic behind this step.

### Denial Pattern Tracking Over Time

When denials do come back  -  and some always will  -  MDCharts tracks them by reason code and payer. CO-4, CO-16, CO-97, PR-1  -  patterns build over time. If the same CARC code keeps appearing from the same payer for the same procedure range, that is a signal something upstream needs to change, not just another denial to work.

That is how the data from your denial history becomes a tool for process improvement rather than just a queue management problem.

## A Scenario Worth Walking Through

A specialty practice was seeing recurring denials from one commercial payer  -  always the same procedure code range, always the same denial reason. The billing team was working them efficiently. Most were overturned on appeal. It was treated as a normal part of operations.

When the root cause was examined, the issue had nothing to do with how the appeals were being handled. The payer had updated their prior authorization requirements for that procedure category in a policy change. The change had not been caught. Claims were going out without the required auth, and every one of them came back denied.

Once the authorization requirements were updated in MDCharts and eligibility flagging was configured for that payer's current rules, the denials for that code range stopped. The team hadn't been making a billing error. They were operating on outdated assumptions  -  and without a system that checks auth requirements at the point of scheduling, there was no early warning.

The fix was configuration, not headcount. The denials had been running for months before anyone traced them to a policy update rather than a billing mistake.

## Three Questions Worth Asking Right Now

Before investing in any new denial management workflow or technology, these three questions will tell you whether your problem is upstream or downstream  -  and that determines what kind of fix actually helps.

- What are your top five denial reason codes by volume over the last 90 days?
- What percentage of those trace back to eligibility or registration errors at intake?
- How many denied claims from last quarter were never resubmitted at all?

If the answers point upstream  -  which they usually do  -  the solution is not a faster appeal process. It is catching the errors before the claim leaves. That is where the conversation with MDCharts starts.

    title: "From AI Hype to Real ROI: 5 Things Practices Need to Know About Automation in the Revenue Cycle",
    excerpt: "Every RCM vendor has AI in their pitch deck. But where does it actually deliver - and where do the claims outpace the evidence? Here are five things worth knowing before you invest, expand, or dismiss AI in your revenue cycle.",
    content: `
## 01 Most Practices Believe in AI - Very Few Are Actually Using It

Experian Health's State of Claims 2025 report found that **67% of providers believe AI can improve the claims process.** Only 14% are currently using it to reduce denials.

That gap between belief and deployment is telling. The hesitation isn't about whether AI works. Revenue cycle leaders consistently cite three specific concerns: data privacy, accuracy, and cost. And underneath all of that is a harder question - with so many vendors claiming AI capabilities, how do you tell which ones actually deliver?

The answer almost always comes down to outcome data. Vendors with real results show you denial rate changes, first-pass acceptance rate movement, and days in AR reduction from comparable practices. Those without real results show you feature lists.

> **Key Takeaway:** Ask any AI vendor to show you actual outcome data from practices similar to yours. Projected benefits are not the same as proven results.

## 02 AI Works Best at the Front End - Before the Claim Goes Out

The most consistent ROI from AI in RCM comes from the front end of the cycle - eligibility verification and prior authorization. The task is well-defined, the data is structured, and the impact of getting it wrong shows up clearly in denial rates.

Menlo Ventures' 2025 State of AI in Healthcare report flagged prior authorization automation as one of the fastest-growing AI deployment categories in healthcare - because **the ROI is immediate and measurable.** Authorizations that previously took significant staff time can be processed far faster. That directly cuts one of the most common and most preventable denial categories.

The limitation is integration. An eligibility AI tool that operates outside your EHR and billing system still requires manual handoff steps. The value compounds when verification is embedded directly in the scheduling and check-in workflow - so the flag happens at the moment someone can act on it.

> **Key Takeaway:** Front-end AI tools that prevent denials are generally more valuable than back-end tools that automate appeals. Prevention beats recovery every time.

## 03 Coding Automation Is Real - With One Important Caveat

Coding and billing automation attracted significant healthcare AI investment in 2025, according to Menlo Ventures. The reason is clear: **coding errors are a leading cause of claim denials,** and the volume of coding decisions required across a busy practice creates pressure that manual review alone struggles to keep up with.

What AI does well here is pattern recognition across large claim datasets - identifying when a diagnosis and procedure combination is likely to trigger a denial with a specific payer, surfacing missing modifiers, flagging NCCI bundling conflicts before submission. It handles the high-volume routine checks at a speed no billing team can match.

Lee Kupferman, EVP at R1, put it plainly in a March 2026 STAT News piece: cleaner claims from AI-assisted review **improve first-pass yield, reduce denials and appeals, lower rework cost, and accelerate cash** - with gains in one area reinforcing gains in others over time.

**The caveat:** AI coding tools are only as good as the clinical documentation they work from. If the underlying encounter notes are incomplete or ambiguous, AI amplifies that problem. Clean source data is not optional.

> **Key Takeaway:** AI can support your coders on high-volume routine checks - but it cannot substitute for clinical documentation quality or specialty-specific coding judgment on complex cases.

## 04 Your Denial History Is a Data Asset - Most Practices Aren't Using It

A billing team reviewing denials in a queue sees individual claims. An AI system reviewing the same data sees patterns - the same CARC code repeating from the same payer for the same procedure range, a modifier consistently missing on a specific service type, a documentation gap correlating with a cluster of medical necessity denials.

Those patterns exist in your denial data right now. The question is whether your workflow surfaces them fast enough to act on them - or whether they stay buried in a report that nobody has time to analyze thoroughly.

EY's 2026 analysis of AI-driven RCM described the shift clearly: AI allows organizations to move from **reacting to denials toward preventing them** - by converting denial history into a continuous improvement feedback loop rather than just a queue to work through. Organizations that use denial data as a diagnostic tool consistently outperform those that don't.

> **Key Takeaway:** Your historical denial data is one of the most underused assets in your revenue cycle. AI turns that data into a prevention roadmap - not just faster appeals.

## 05 Integration Determines Whether AI Delivers - or Just Adds Complexity

This is the one that most vendor conversations skip over. The practices getting measurable results from AI share a common characteristic: they are not running AI as a point solution bolted onto an existing workflow.

They are running it in a platform where clinical documentation, eligibility verification, coding, billing, and denial tracking all operate from the same data layer. When those components are connected, AI can work across the entire cycle rather than one piece of it.

McKinsey's January 2026 analysis of agentic AI in the revenue cycle was direct about this: health systems collectively spend more than **$140 billion annually on revenue cycle operations,** with manual processes and fragmented vendor landscapes as major contributors. Nearly 20% of claims are denied on average, and as many as 60% of those are never appealed - representing millions in lost revenue per practice per year. The path forward requires **integrated data and unified logic** across the full cycle, not disconnected point solutions.

When your EHR, billing, and RCM run in separate systems with manual handoffs between them, AI tools in any one of those systems are working with incomplete information. The seams between disconnected tools are exactly where errors accumulate - and where AI's value gets diluted.

MDCharts is built as an integrated EHR and RCM platform for exactly this reason. Clinical documentation, eligibility verification, superbill generation, claim validation, and denial tracking all operate from the same patient and encounter data. That integration is what allows each step in the cycle to inform the next - which is the precondition for AI to actually work the way the demos suggest.

> **Key Takeaway:** If your EHR, billing, and RCM are running in separate systems with manual handoffs between them, the AI conversation is premature. Fix the integration first. That is where the real revenue is.

## The Questions Worth Asking

Before expanding AI use in your revenue cycle - or evaluating a new platform - these four questions cut through the noise:

- Where does the AI intervene? Pre-submission tools that prevent denials are worth more than post-denial tools that automate appeals.
- Is it embedded in your actual workflow - or does staff need to go to a separate tool to use it? Adoption drops sharply when AI requires an extra step outside the normal process.
- What happens when it gets it wrong? Every AI system has an error rate. Is there a human review step for high-risk decisions, or do errors go straight through?
- Can the vendor show outcome data from comparable practices? Not projected benefits. Actual denial rate changes, first-pass acceptance improvement, days in AR movement.

If your current setup has the clinical and billing sides of your practice running in disconnected systems, start there. MDCharts is built to give practices that integrated foundation. Reach out to the team to walk through how this applies to your specific setup and specialty.

    title: "Your Patients Want to Pay You. So Why Are You Making It So Hard?",
    excerpt: "Patient financial responsibility is rising while collection rates are falling. The problem isn't unwilling patients — it's friction. Here's how to fix it.",
    content: `I want to tell you about a scenario I've seen play out at more practices than I can count. A patient comes in, the visit goes fine, they leave. A paper statement gets mailed to an address that's two moves out of date. It sits unopened in a stack of mail. Thirty days pass. The practice sends another statement. By the time someone calls, the patient has no memory of the balance and very little motivation to pay quickly.

The patient wasn't trying to avoid the bill. They just never had a real opportunity to pay it. The process failed them before they even had a chance to engage. That's the patient collections problem in one paragraph — not unwilling patients, but friction.

## The Numbers Tell a Difficult Story

Patient financial responsibility has been climbing steadily, while the percentage patients actually pay has been declining. Insured patient yield dropped from 45.1% in 2024 to 42.4% in 2025. The HFMA and PayZen 2026 survey of revenue cycle leaders found that practices are collecting less than a third of total patient billings — two out of every three dollars billed directly to patients isn't making it back.

> **Cedar analyzed 1.5 billion patient financial interactions and found that 90% of patients now receive bills through their preferred channels — yet collection rates remain flat. The problem isn't delivery. It's what stands in the way.**

## What Patients Actually Want

The message from patient preference research is consistent: pay digitally, pay fast, pay from a phone. TrustCommerce's 2024 Healthcare Payment Trends Report found the majority of patients prefer paying by debit or credit card. Inovalon's research found that nearly two-thirds of consumers prefer paying medical bills online. Among patients under 35, nearly three-quarters said they had switched providers — or would — for a better payment experience. Billing experience is now a retention factor, not just a back-office metric.

Text-based payment links are where the real shift is happening. SMS has a 98% open rate compared to roughly 20% for email. Studies on text-based payment reminders consistently show significantly higher payment rates, with a meaningful share of patients paying within minutes of receiving a secure link.

## When You Collect Matters as Much as How

MGMA's 2025 benchmarking data makes something very clear: practices that collect at time of service consistently outperform peers who wait to bill patients after insurance processing. The HFMA/PayZen 2026 survey showed pre-service collections improving year over year as more practices capture payment — or at least a card on file — during the estimate stage.

The patient's motivation to pay is highest right after their visit. Every week that passes between the encounter and the statement is a week of motivation you've lost. A good payment workflow catches the patient at multiple moments — at check-in, immediately post-visit, and again when the balance finalizes.

## What MDCharts Is Doing About This

MDCharts is an integrated EHR and RCM platform, meaning billing isn't a separate system bolted on after the fact. Patient balances, claim statuses, and A/R are visible within the same workflow providers use to document care — removing the handoff delays where balances typically fall through the cracks.

We're now integrating with a payment gateway to complete the patient payment picture. The platform has been recognized as Best in KLAS for Patient Financial Engagement for two consecutive years — 2025 and 2026. Healthcare organizations using the integrated payment tools have reported a 15% to 50% increase in online payments.

Once the integration goes live, MDCharts practices will be able to send patients a secure payment link right after their visit — no portal login required, no paper chase. The patient gets a text or email, taps the link, and pays. The practice gets faster collections and fewer hours spent on follow-up calls.

## Make It Easy or Chase It Forever

Technology alone doesn't fix a broken collections process. But a tight strategy — one that combines early conversations, digital payment links, and a smart follow-up cadence — does. The practices winning on collections right now are doing a few things consistently:

- Collecting or capturing a card on file at time of service, before care is delivered
- Sending a payment link within hours of the visit, while it's still top of mind
- Using text and email together — not just paper statements mailed three weeks later
- Following up once or twice with a simple link, not repeated calls with no easy resolution

Patients are not the problem. Friction is. Remove the friction, and the money follows.
